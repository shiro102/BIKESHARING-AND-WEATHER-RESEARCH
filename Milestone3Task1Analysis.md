# Task 1: Address project feedback
We are lucky this week and we have very little to report on for this task. Our TA said "Excellent Job" and that is all. 
I was worried we had missed something. 
But, when i messaged Dr.Moosvi he said we had nothing to report on and our analysis for Milestone 2 was good enough that it warranted no further analysis or feeback!
