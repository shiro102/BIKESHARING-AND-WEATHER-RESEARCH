## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Through the group project, we are hoping to acquire more in-depth knowledge regarding data analytics and advance our technical skillset. In today’s contemporary world, reducing carbon footprint and living environmentally-friendly is absolutely crucial, thus; our group decided to use data on bike sharing to do our data analysis project. Using data on bike sharing, we will further explore the correlation between people’s decision to rent a bike and weather condition, precisely wind speed and humidity. Our data analysis will aim to answer this question: “Is there any correlation between renting a bike and weather condition (humidity & wind speed), if so what is considered as a best weather and worst weather to rent a bike?”. We aspire that bike-sharing companies will be able to construct and develop a marketing strategy with our data analysis; therefore, encourage communities and individuals to choose eco-friendly and healthy options such as cycling. We can imagine building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset in the final weeks of this course.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We decide to use one of the datasets given by Dr.Moosvi. The dataset is the Bikeshare data. This dataset includes two components. The bike components are supplied by _Capital Bikeshar_, which contains data including cyclist trip length, the bike stations interacted with etc. Next is the info from _Freemeteo_ that includes all the weather-related data. Info includes temperature, humidity etc. Researchers compiled all this information at the "Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support" at the _University of Porto_. The dataset takes info from the years 2011-2012 early on in the life of _Capital Bikeshare_. The team at the _University of Porto_  researched this topic because it can be used to watch bike-share traffic and interpret it as a sort of living sensor for mobility in metropolitan areas. _Capital Bikeshare_ express that they put their data put into the world because people kept asking questions about their "most popular stations" and whatnot. So they released the information for anyone to use in a way that "moves" them. The data was collected through a combination of server logs on _Capitol Bikeshare's_ part and digitalized historical records from _Freemeteo_.
